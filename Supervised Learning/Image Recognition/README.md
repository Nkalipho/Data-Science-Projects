## Introduction
Image recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision. This project demonstrates the use of CNNs to recognize and classify images with high accuracy. The end-to-end pipeline covers data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment with a web application.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of labeled images for classification. The data was split into training, validation, and testing sets to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.

### Preprocessing
- Resized all images to a uniform size.
- Normalized pixel values to range between 0 and 1.
- Augmented the dataset with transformations like rotation, flipping, and scaling.

## Features
- Input: Image data with dimensions suitable for CNN processing.
- Output: Class probabilities and predictions for each image.

## Implementation
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Handled missing data and ensured a consistent format for the input images.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Designed a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
   - Used activation functions like ReLU and a softmax output layer.

3. **Training:**
   - Utilized the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
   - Trained the model over multiple epochs with batch normalization.

4. **Evaluation:**
   - Measured performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Deployment
The trained model was deployed as a web application using the following components:
- **Backend:** `app2_image_recognition.py` (Flask API for inference).
- **Frontend:** `index2.html` (User interface for image uploads and predictions).

Users can upload an image via the web interface, and the application returns the predicted class.

## Results
- Achieved an accuracy of **95%** on the test set.
- The model successfully generalizes to unseen images.
- Deployment provides a seamless user experience for real-time predictions.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Train the model (optional):
   ```bash
   python Image_recognition_CNN.ipynb
   ```
4. Start the web application:
   ```bash
   python app2_image_recognition.py
   ```
5. Open `index2.html` in a browser to upload images and view predictions.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of CNNs in image recognition tasks. By combining robust preprocessing, efficient model design, and user-friendly deployment, it showcases the potential for real-world applications. Future work could include extending the model to handle larger datasets and integrating additional features such as object detection.
